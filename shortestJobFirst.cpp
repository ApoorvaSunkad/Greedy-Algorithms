Geek is a software engineer. He is assigned with the task of calculating 
average waiting time of all the processes by following shortest job first 
policy.

The shortest job first (SJF) or shortest job next, is a scheduling policy 
that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute 
next.

Given an array of integers bt of size n. Array bt denotes the burst time of 
each process. Calculate the average waiting time of all the processes and 
return the nearest integer which is smaller or equal to the output.

Note: Consider all process are available at time 0.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
bt = [4,3,7,1,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: After sorting burst times by shortest job policy, 
calculated average waiting time is 4.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
arr = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: After sorting burst times by shortest job policy, calculated 
average waiting time is 2.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete 
the function solve() which takes bt[] as input parameter and returns the 
average waiting time of all the processes.

Expected Time Complexity: O(nlog(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 105

        long long time = 0, waitTime = 0;
        long long n = bt.size();
        
        for(int i = 0; i<n;i++){
            waitTime+=time;
            time = time+bt[i];
        }
        
        return waitTime/n;
